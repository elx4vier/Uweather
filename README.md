**UWeather** is a fast and lightweight weather extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).  
It uses the free [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to provide current weather and a 3‑day forecast.  
The extension supports automatic location detection, manual city selection, and three interface styles.  
Translations are included for multiple languages.
